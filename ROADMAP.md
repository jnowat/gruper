# Gruper Roadmap

Current version: **v0.4.5 — Streamlined UX**

This roadmap reflects the project's current trajectory and known improvement areas. Because Gruper is a single-file, zero-build application, priorities are weighted toward high-value changes that preserve that simplicity rather than adding tooling overhead.

---

## Architecture Philosophy

Gruper's single-file model (`Gruper.html`) is **intentional and permanent** for the foreseeable future. The entire application — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — ships as one file you double-click to open. No install, no server, no build step.

This means:
- Feature additions happen inside `Gruper.html`
- External dependencies stay CDN-loaded (Chart.js, DOMPurify)
- State lives in `localStorage`
- There is no bundler, transpiler, or package manager

The single-file ethos becomes a constraint if/when `Gruper.html` grows beyond ~500 KB or the JavaScript block exceeds ~5,000 lines and navigability becomes painful. We are not near those limits yet (~260 KB / ~3,370 JS lines as of v0.4.5), but this is worth tracking.

## Near-term (v0.5.x)

Items with known scope and low architectural risk.

### P1 — UX & Usability

- **Conversation search** — find text across all rounds and conversations
- **Agent response diff view** — highlight where agents agree vs. diverge per round
- **Pinnable messages** — mark specific agent responses to reference later
- **Export to Markdown** — readable export format alongside the existing JSON

### P2 — Configuration

- **Agent groups / presets** — save and reload a named set of 6 agents with one click
- **Per-conversation agent overrides** — change an agent's model mid-conversation without resetting
- **More stop-sequence templates** per agent type

### P3 — Maintenance & Quality

- **Reduce inline `onclick` handlers** (62 currently) — migrate to `addEventListener` calls for CSP compatibility and testability; can be done incrementally without breaking the single-file model
- **Add screenshot examples to README** — remove the "coming soon" placeholder
- **localStorage usage meter** — show current storage consumption and a manual clear option in the UI
- ~~**GitHub Actions: SRI re-verification**~~ ✅ Done 2026-06-27
- ~~**GitHub Actions: line-count trend**~~ ✅ Done 2026-06-27

## Medium-term (v0.6.x)

Items that are desirable but require more design work or carry higher risk.

- **Streaming responses** — stream token-by-token from Ollama instead of waiting for full completion
- **Conversation branching** — fork a conversation at a given round to explore alternative paths
- **Agent memory summaries** — compress earlier context into a structured summary when depth limit is hit, rather than truncating
- **WebSocket / SSE streaming** — real-time token-by-token output if the Ollama/LocalAI backend supports it
- **Multi-tab real-time sync** — use `BroadcastChannel` so conversations started in one tab appear in another without a page reload
- **LocalAI model discovery** — auto-populate model list from LocalAI's `/v1/models` endpoint

---

## Long-term / Architectural

- **Optional ES module build** — if the single JS block exceeds ~5,000 lines, introduce a lightweight `esbuild` / `rollup` bundler step (output is still one `.html` file) so the source can be split into logical modules without changing the distribution model
- **PWA shell** — `manifest.json` + service worker for offline use and home-screen installation
- **Tauri wrapper** (optional) — package Gruper as a native desktop app with filesystem access and tray integration; the HTML/JS core stays unchanged
- **First-run tutorial / onboarding overlay** for new users
- **Localization support (i18n)** for non-English users
- **Integration tests via Playwright** against a mock Ollama server

---

## Out of scope (intentionally)

- **Server-side component** — Gruper is and will remain a client-only app; no backend
- **Account system / cloud sync** — state stays in localStorage; sync is out of scope
- **npm/pip packages** — no package manager; CDN only
- **Framework rewrite** (React/Vue/Svelte) — not planned; vanilla JS is a feature, not a limitation

---

## Known technical debt

| Item | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 62 inline `onclick` handlers | Medium | Blocks strict CSP; refactor incrementally |
| No automated tests | Medium | Single-file architecture makes unit tests awkward; smoke tests via Playwright feasible |
| `localStorage` growth | Low | Quota guard is in place; a usage meter and trim UI would be nice |
| File size growth trend | Low | ~260 KB today; monitor monthly |
| README screenshots | Low | "Coming soon" placeholder — needs real images |
